# Lab Report 1
*below is running the command of cd with a path to a directory, which is lecture1, as an argument*
![Image](cddirectory.png)
after entering command cd lecture1, it moved from home (user@sahara -) to (user@sahara -/lecture1), entering the directory lecture1

*below is running the command of cd with a path to a file, which is cs.txt as an argument*
![Image](cdfile.png)
after running command cd cs.txt, it said "no such file or directory". this would be an error as directories are folders that store information, such as files. to cd into a file would not be possible as files do not store other files, therefore would not be considered a directory.

*below is running solely the command of cd from the current location of the terminal*
